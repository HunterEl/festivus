# Festivus

_A Festivus for the rest of us_

A library to provide typed interfaces and definitions for the [Fantasy-land spec](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) and some other FP/Haskell types.

This is most likely a terrible idea, but will serve as a learning tool and a way to lower the barrier to entry for FP/Category theory concepts.

## Why

I was noticing a trend where people tend to stop their functional programming education after learning a couple of useful tools (E.G `List.of(Map, Filter, Reduce, Monads)`), but I believe that there is tremendous value in providing a flexible and well-documented type-system to implement your own FP-libraries or for educational use.

## What Will Happen Here?

This is obviously in very early stages, so the API/Interface contracts will be shifting for some time, but the basic goal of `this` repository is to provide just the interface contracts from the [Fantasy-land spec](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) and other useful FP/Haskell types/libs.

## What's With The Name?

[Festivus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus). Man-made and we all want to celebrate it, but there will be consequences. Like Festivus, it should be for the rest of us.
